Description: Green Machine is a food generator built to promote sustainibility and reduce waste. The user can enter ingredients they have lying around their home and they will be matched with a recipe containing at least one of their inputed ingredients.  

Running/Building Code: To run the code, clone this git repo and use docker to host the generator locally. 
After moving into the Project directory type 'docker-compose up' in your terminal. There will be a message at the end ('3000 is the magic port!'). You can then navigate to your localhost and access the project.

Testing: We manually tested our code by viewing it on our local hosts and making sure each feature we implemented worked correctly. If not, we would go through our code and debug. 

Repo Structure: All project code is under the 'project' folder in our repository. In this folder, we have our .js and json files. Moreover, we have our database called 'init_date' There is also a 'views' folder that contains all of our active website pages as well as an img folder inside to store photos. Aside from project code we have a folder for Milestones and other files that we saved just in case we needed them.
